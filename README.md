# PL-starter
this is a simple starter cookiecutter for python libraries
it is based on docker and it assumes two seperate enviromnets (a dev and prod seperated by environment variables) 
but envrionment variables can also be left empty but whenever you have one you can just put them in the repseciv.env files and they get loaded in the docker 
image by docker compose.
